# Kmeans-Implementation-and-Analysis

Problem Statement:

1.A: What is the most common reason for calling 911?
1.B: Display these results graphically
2.A: Please create a graph of the 911 calls using the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' (graph type is up to you) (differentiate call type using colors)
2.B: Are there any data points that look mislabeled?
3.A: If we were to use only 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', could we make an intelligent decision as to why a resident dialed 911? (In other words, if we take off the labels - can we still determine which category a 911 call would most likely fall into?) Please describe this algorithm and your reason for choosing it.
3.B: Does the algorithm chosen utilize Euclidean distance? Should we be concerned that 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' are not necessarily Euclidean?
3.C: Please display the results of your algorithm, along with the associated code 3.D: Please display the number of correct categorizations
3.E: What insight can we extract from this analysis?
